# TÃ­tulo por determinar

This will be my final degree project's (TFG in Spanish) repository.

In folder 'Code' all the most recent Python programs can be found. In folder 'Plots' can be found all the made plots (at the moment the used parameters in th esimulated data are 0.3, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2.5, 0.5, 0.25, 5, 0, 50, 2, 7, 1, 0, 101). In folder 'Data' there are a couple data files from Tres2b and Kepler75b. 

To run the code, maintain the structure of the repository and simply run the main code ('main.py').
