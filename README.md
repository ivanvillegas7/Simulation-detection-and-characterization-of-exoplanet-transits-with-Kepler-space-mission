# Simulation, detection, and characterization of exoplanet transits' with Kepler space mission

This will be my final degree project's (TFG in Spanish) repository.

In folder 'Code' all the most recent Python programs can be found. In folder 'Plots' can be found all the made plots using simulated data, and data from TrES-2 b and Kepler-75 b

In folder 'Data' there are a couple data files from Tres2b and Kepler75b. 

To run the code, maintain the structure of the repository and simply run the main code ('main.py').

If you want to meke the same simulation I did, check the final report ('TFG - Iván Villeags Pérez.pdf') for the parameters.
