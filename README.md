# TÃ­tulo por determinar

This will be my final degree project's (TFG in Spanish) repository.

Folder 'First tests' containes all the files relative to the very first test, which might probably be deleted any time soon.

In folder 'Code' all the most recent Python programs can be found. In folder 'TrES2b' can be found all the data relative to star TrES2. In this folder, two others can be found, one for 'Short' cadence and 'Long' cadence data.

To run the code, maintain the structure of the repository and simply run the main code ('main.py').
