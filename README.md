This will be my final degree project's (TFG in Spanish) repository.

In folder 'Code' all the most recent Python programs can be found. In folder 'Plots' can be found all the made plots (at the moment the used parameters in th esimulated data are the following:


  ·Do you want to simulate (S) or to read (R) real data? S
  
  
  ·Outlier fraction: 0.3
  
  ·Non-central Student's t distribution degrees of freedom: 3
  
  ·Non-central paarameter: 1
  
  ·Non-central Student's t distribution mean value: 0
  
  ·Non-central Student's t distribution scale: 1
  
  
  ·Transit period: 2.5
  
  ·Transit duration: 0.5
  
  ·Transit half time: 0.25
  
  ·Transit depth: 5
  
  ·Initial time: 0
  
  ·Ending time: 50
  
  
  ·Sinusoidal variability amplitude: 2
  
  ·Sinusoidal variability period: 7
  
  ·Sinusoidal variability phase (in units of π): 1
  
  ·Stellar flux offset (order of magnitude): 5e6
  
  
  ·Window size for the median filter: 101


In folder 'Data' there are a couple data files from Tres2b and Kepler75b. 

To run the code, maintain the structure of the repository and simply run the main code ('main.py').
