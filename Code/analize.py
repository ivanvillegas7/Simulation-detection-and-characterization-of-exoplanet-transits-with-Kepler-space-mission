This Python script defines six functions: median_filter, best_fit_func,
best_fit, get_period, time_convert and characterization.

The median_filter function applies a median filter of a given window size to a
flux array. It takes three parameters: time (an array of time values), flux (an
array of flux values), and window_size (the size of the window used for the
median filter). The function returns an array of filtered flux values. The
function also generates two plots: one of the original and filtered flux data
and one of the filtered flux data.

The best_fit_func function models the light curve of a star with a transit and
a sinusoidal signal. It takes eight parameters: x (an array of time values for 
the light curve), a (the amplitude of the sinusoidal signal), b (the period of
the sinusoidal signal), c (the phase of the sinusoidal signal), d (the offset of
the sinusoidal signal), t0 (the time of the center of the transit), p (the
period of the transit), dur (the duration of the transit), and dep (the depth of
the transit). The function returns an array of the modeled light curve.

The best_fit function fits a set of data (x,y) to a user-defined function using
the curve_fit function from scipy.optimize. It takes two parameters: x (an array
of independent variable values, i.e., time) and y (an array of dependent variable
values, i.e., flux). The function returns the parameters of the best fit. The
function also generates a plot of the filtered flux data and its best fit.

The get_period function calculates the period of a periodic signal in the input
flux data. It first calculates the periodogram using the SciPy signal processing
library's periodogram function. Then, it finds the frequency with the highest
power (i.e. the dominant frequency) and calculates the period corresponding to
that frequency. Finally, it plots the periodogram and saves the plot as
'Periodogram.pdf' in the 'Plots' folder.

The time_convert function takes a single argument, seconds, which is the total
number of seconds to be converted into days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The
function first computes the complete number of days by dividing the total number
of seconds by the number of seconds in a day, which is 246060. It then computes
the remaining number of seconds that cannot be expressed as complete days by
using the operator '%'. It does the same operation until it the reamining time
can only be expressed as seconds.

The characterization function characterizes an exoplanet based on its light
curve, taking into account the stellar variability. The function then uses
get_period to obtain the period of the planet's orbit. It prompts the user for
the star's radius and mass to compute the planet's radius and distance from the
star, respectively. It also calculates the orbital inclination of the planet.
The function does not return anything; it only prints the computed results.

The functions use various modules such as numpy, matplotlib, and scipy. In
summary, these functions can be used to process and analyze data from a star's
light curve, including smoothing out noise, fitting the data to a user-defined
function, and calculating the period of a periodic signal in the data.
